### Testing

`mocha --require babel-register`.

### TODO
**Core**

* Write a script (make it a Python notebook, or trying doing it in Node.JS?) which parses the raw CitiBike data to generate a station manifest.
* Write tests and write a method for getting station manifests by date (for use in the animation).
* Write test and write a method for getting the station manifest on our day of interest.

**Redux**
* Write the Redux layer (continue to [follow along](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)).

**Front End**
* React, re-using the previous component work, but now with a data store in the middle making things a whole lotta times
simpler.
